# Fund or Cancel Bets

After creating a bet each party has the oppurtunity to fund it or cancel it if they do not like the terms. Newly created bets that are not fully funded appear in the **Unfunded Bets** tab.

## Canceling a Bet

Even if you have already funded the bet, you still may cancel it and get your money back as long as the other side as not yet funded it. However, once the bet is fully funded then only the Judge may cancel the bet. The Maker or Taker may cancel any bet they are a party to as long as it is not fully funded. The Judge may cancel the bet at any time regardless of status. 

## Funding a bet 

If the terms are acceptable you may fund the bet by clicking  **Fund Bet**  and paying the wager amount. The bet will remain in the Unfunded Bets tab until each part does its part and funds it. Only the Maker and Taker can fund bets, if they were incorrectly selected then you must cancel the bet and create it again.
