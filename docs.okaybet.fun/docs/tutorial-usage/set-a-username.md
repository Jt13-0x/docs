Click the **Set Username** button to expand it as shown below:

Pick any name you like as long as it is unique. Registering a username records a transaction onchain so it will cost a miniscule amount of gas, in-app wallets sponser this for free. 

## Benefits of Usernames 

It is recommended to pick out your own unique username as it makes it easier for other people to bet with you. Bets can be made by wallet address, ens address, or username. While all of these reslove to wallet addresses, bets are easier to manage and read when using clear usernames. 

Registering a username simply ties your wallet address to a string of text on a smart contract. Usernames are not part of the betting contract and when making bets you should still confirm the address of the username that is being resloved.
