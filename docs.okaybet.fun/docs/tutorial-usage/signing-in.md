## In-App Wallet

If you do not already have a wallet or do not want to expose your current wallet to a new application then you can easily make a new in-app wallet. 

In-App wallets are created by smart contracts that allow for extended abstraction and features. This means the user can make a wallet from thier phone number email, address, or other social accounts instead of needing to remember thier private keys. Additionally In-App wallets have transaction fees on the Okay Bet contracts completely subsidized. 

You can create an In-app wallet by deciding to sign in with your email, phone number or any of the options on the right side of the column. This is the easiest and most recommended way to use Okay Bet. If you create an In-app wallet and later decide to use it in other places you may even export the private key and take it with you. 

## Connect Wallet

Okay Bet supports over 350 different types of cryptocurrency wallets. If you have one already it should be on the left side and as easy to connect as any other app.
