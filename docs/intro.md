# What is Okay Bet?


## Introduction

Okay Bet is a peer to peer betting platform that uses ecrow smart contracts to allow people to make wagers with eachother. All wagers are made in ether on the Base L2 network. 

## How it works 

There are 3 parties that make up a bet the Maker, the Taker, and the Judge. 

### Maker

This person makes and funds the bet contract. They need to specify the bet conditions, the addresses of the other parties, and the amount wagered. 

### Taker

This person reads the bet and decides whether to accept or reject it. If they accept then they fund the bet and niether the Maker or the Taker can pull out thier funds until the bet is resolved.

### Judge

This person is the one that decides who wins the bet. It may be the Maker or the Taker or it could be a third person that both parties trust with thier wager. The Judge reads the wager conditions and determines who won the bet, or whether they bet should be cancelled. If cancelled then the wager is refunded. If the Judge picks a winner then all of the funds in the contract will go to the winner's account. 

## Liability

Bets should only be made with parties you know and trust. The outcome of the bet is entirely up to the descrection of the Judge regardless of wager conditions. 

Okay Bet does not custody any wagers or determine who wins any wagers. The smart contracts are deployed and work entirely peer to peer. Please do your own research, and use at your own risk. Betting with your friends is for fun, not investment. Please do not rug your friends.
