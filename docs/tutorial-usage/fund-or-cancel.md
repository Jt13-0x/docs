# Fund or Cancel Bets

After creating a bet each party has the oppurtunity to fund or cancel if they do not agree with the terms. Newly created bets which are not fully funded appear in the **Unfunded Bets** tab.

## Canceling a Bet

In the event of a bet already being funded, you may cancel it and have your funds returned as long as the other party has not yet deposited funds towards the wager. However, once the bet is fully funded, only the Judge may cancel the bet. The Maker or Taker may cancel any bet they have partaken as long as it is not fully funded. The Judge may cancel the bet at any time regardless of status. 

## Funding a bet 

If the terms are acceptable you may fund the bet by clicking  **Fund Bet** and depositing the wager amount. The bet will remain in the Unfunded Bets tab until each part does its part and funds it. Only the Maker and Taker can fund bets. If the roles were assigned incorrectly, you'll need to cancel the bet and create it again.
