# Resolve a Bet

Once a bet is fully funded the action is locked in until the Judge decides the outcome. Fully funded bets appear on the the **Open Bets** tab and user is not able to do anything but share it unless they are the Judge.

If the user is logged in as the Judge of the bet they have options to reslove the Bet

## Declare Winner

Either the Maker or Taker can be declared as the Winner of the bet. Declaring the winner resolves the bet and empties the funds of the bet contract into that address. Wins and losses are also tracked onchain which may be more important than the money.

## Invalidate Bet 

If there is not a clear winner the Judge has the authority to invalidate the bet which refunds both parties. Bets can be cancelled for any reason from unclear terms, unexpected outcomes, or that the Judge just doesn't want the responsibility it is entirely at thier descretion. 

In the example case it looks like this bet should be invalidated since the Eagles do not play the Steelers in 2025 NFL Season.
