Pick any name you like as long as it is unique. Registering a username records a transaction onchain therefore, it will cost a miniscule amount in gas, however, in-app wallets sponser this for free. 

## Benefits of Usernames 

It is recommended to pick out your own unique username as it makes it easier for other people to bet with you. Bets can be made with wallet addresses, ens addresses, or usernames. While all of these reslove to wallet addresses, bets are easier to read and manage when using clear usernames. 

Registering a username simply ties your wallet address to a string of text on a smart contract. Usernames are not part of the betting contract and when making bets, you should still confirm the address of the username that is being resloved.
