The idea for Okay Bet started at the [Base Onchain Summer Hackathon](https://devfolio.co/projects/bets-with-friends-4af6). [Thirdweb](https://thirdweb.com/) sponsored the gaming track, and I decided to make a betting game based on escrow contracts in the parody style of [Words with Friends](https://wordswithfriends.com/).

Bets With Friends was deployed on the Base Sepolia testnet and, while janky, had the core betting functionality working great.

Unfortunately, my entry did not become a finalist, but I choose to believe it is due to Coinbase and our other lovely sponsors not wanting anything to do with appearing to sponsor gambling. I do not share those reservations, so I decided to continue with Okay Bet.
