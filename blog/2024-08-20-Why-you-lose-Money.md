[Nate Silver](https://www.natesilver.net/), Mr. 538, has a podcast called [Risky Business](https://www.pushkin.fm/podcasts/risky-business-with-nate-silver-maria-konnikova/lessons-from-the-river-maria-interviews-nate-about-his-book), and in his latest episode he mentioned that tried his hand at sportsbetting for the NBA season. He wagered a total of 1.8 million dollars and spent about 5000 hours to win $5000. Let's see why he got a raw deal.

## The Juice

## The Numbers

According to Silver's own account on the Risky Business podcast:
- Total amount wagered: $1.8 million
- Net profit: $5,000
- Average bet size: $1,200
- Estimated number of bets: 1,500

At first glance, a $5,000 profit might seem decent. But let's put this into perspective.

## Analysis

### The Impact of Juice

One of the biggest factors eating into Silver's profits is the "juice" or "vig" charged by sportsbooks. Our analysis shows:

As we can see, to overcome a typical 4.5% juice, Silver needed to win about 52.5% of his bets just to break even.

### Potential Profits Without Juice

If we remove the effect of juice, Silver's performance looks quite different:

Without the sportsbooks taking their cut, Silver's $5,000 profit could have been closer to $90,000!

## Conclusion

Nate Silver's experience highlights a crucial lesson for aspiring sports bettors: Even with deep statistical knowledge and a solid strategy, the house edge makes consistent profit extremely challenging. The sportsbooks' juice effectively erased what could have been significant winnings.

This doesn't mean sports betting can't be profitable, but it underscores the immense difficulty of beating the house over the long run. For most people, sports betting should be viewed as entertainment rather than a reliable way to make money.

Remember, if even Nate Silver struggles to come out significantly ahead, the average bettor faces an even steeper uphill battle.
